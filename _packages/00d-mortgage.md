## Step 4: Apply for a Mortgage Loan

If you are taking out a bank loan, youâ€™ll want to receive approval in principle (AIP) from them.

If you are taking out a HDB Housing loan, submit request for [Housing Loan Eligibility (HLE) letter](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BP27AWHLEApplication/BP27SHome).

Tip: Check your [BTO application status](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/new/application-status&rendermode=preview).
