### At a glance

The journey to buying a resale flat can be overwhelming for some of us. We have summed it up in a few steps here. 

- A complete step-by-step guide on HDB resale can be found [here](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/resale/getting-started).

### Step 1: Register Intent to Buy

By registering your Intent to Buy, you will receive an instant assessment on your: 
- Eligibility to buy an HDB resale flat; 
- Housing grants you are eligible for;
- Eligibility for an HDB housing loan

There are no fees involved for this [registration](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/resale/procedures/register-intent-to-buy).

### Step 2: Plan your finances

Work out your sums with [HDB financial planning tools](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/financing-a-flat-purchase/step-by-step-guide-to-financial-planning).

### Step 3: Make informed purchase

Check for these factors regarding the flat you intend to buy:
1. Resale transacted prices;
2. Ethnic integration policy (EIP) quotas;
3. Singapore permanent resident (SPR) quotas

### Step 4: Exercise Option to Purchase (OTP) from seller

HDBâ€™s Option to Purchase (OTP) is basically a form of contract between the buyer (you) and the seller, giving you exclusive right to purchase the flat within the option period of 21 calendar days.

- Read more about the [OTP procedures and key important notes](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/resale/option-to-purchase).

### Step 5: Submit Resale Application

You and the seller (or the salesperson) can proceed to submit the resale application after you have exercised the Option to Purchase (OTP).

- Read more about the [procedures](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/resale/buying-process/application-procedure/resale-application). *[Note that either you or the seller can be the first to submit, but the other party must submit their portion within 7 calendar days.]*
