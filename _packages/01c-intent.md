### Register Intent to Buy

Use this e-Service to [check your eligibility](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BP13EligCheck/BP13SHome?strSystem=CHECK
) by answering a simple questionnaire.

### Step 2: Assess your budget

Use this [financial planning tool](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BP13FINPLAN1/BP13J020) to estimate your budget.

### Step 3: Balloting 

[Find out](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/new/bto-sbf) about upcoming sales launches and apply for the HDB flat you want.

### Step 4: Make Housing Loan arrangements

If you are taking out a bank loan, youâ€™ll want to receive approval in principle (AIP) from them.
  - If you are taking out a HDB Housing loan, submit request for [Housing Loan Eligibility (HLE) letter](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BP27AWHLEApplication/BP27SHome)
  - *Tip: Check your [BTO application status](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/new/application-status&rendermode=preview)*
  
### Step 5: Select & book your flat

You will be required to pay an option fee on the spot when you head down to HDB for the appointment to book your flat.
- $500 for 2-room flexi flats
- $1,000 for 3-room flats 
- $2,000 for 4 room or larger flats

You may also apply for housing grants during this appointment. Find out which one applies to you and download the forms [here](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/new/cpf-housing-grants-for-hdb-flats).

### Step 6: Sign Lease Agreement and pay downpayment

This is usually within four months from the date of booking a flat. Make sure you have arranged for your housing loan by then.
