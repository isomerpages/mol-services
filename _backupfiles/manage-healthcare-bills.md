  - title: Know Your Healthcare Insurance Coverage
    content: |
      All Singaporeans and PRs get basic health insurance <a href="http://www.medishieldlife.sg/" target="_blank">MediShield Life</a> which covers the basic public hospital treatments. 

      The following conditions also illustrates the basic level of MediShield Life coverage:
        - You are staying in a Class B2/C ward
        - Your surgery coverage is capped at S$2,000
        - No pre/post hospitalisation treatments required

      This means you need to top up the difference out of <a href="https://blog.moneysmart.sg/healthcare/medisave-account-singapore-guide/ Medisave or opt for an <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/medishield-life/about-integrated-shield-plans/comparison-of-integrated-shield-plans" target="_blank">Integrated Shield plan (IP)</a> and/or even IP Riders to cover higher medical bills that may come.

      Check if you are currently covered by MediShield Life or Integrated Shield Plan through your <a href="https://www.cpf.gov.sg/eSvc/Web/PortalServices/MoreMessages" target="_blank">CPF Statement of Account</a> under the "Healthcare Section", with your SingPass.
  - title: How Much is Enough
    content: |
      By insurance coverage, we generally refer to the 'sum insured' or 'sum assured' in a life insurance policy. This is the amount you or your dependents get if you die, become permanently disabled, or get a critical illness diagnosis (if covered by your policy). However, do not make your decision based on how expensive your insurance policy is.

      You can determine how much you need based on the following factors:
      - Your liabilities (including monthly bills and outstanding loans)
      - Living expenses (if accidents happen) - e.g. hiring a part-time nurse, transportation, medications
      - Add another 3% annual inflation of cost
      
      *Tip: Refer to the <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/cost-financing/fee-benchmarks-and-bill-amount-information" target="_blank">existing MOH fee benchmarks</a> to see estimated hospital bill size.*
