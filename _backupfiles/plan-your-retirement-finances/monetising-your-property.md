## Monetising your property

If you own an HDB flat or a property in Singapore, you could consider the following options to have another source of retirement income. 


### (A) Right-sizing with Silver Housing Bonus

After retiring, you could consider <a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/living-in-an-hdb-flat/for-our-seniors/right-size-with-silver-housing-bonus" target="_blank">right-sizing your flat</a> and obtain Silver Housing Bonus (SHB) to supplement your retirement income.<br>

You also may consider selling your existing flat and buying a smaller flat from either the resale market or from the HDB.


### (B) HDB Lease BuyBack Scheme (LBS)

In this option, you could continue living in your current HDB flat while selling part of your flatâ€™s lease back to HDB. <br>

The proceeds will be used to top up your CPF Retirement Account (RA), from which you will get a steady income under the CPF Life scheme. <br>

By doing so, you can still continue living in your flat throughout your retirement. <br>

To apply, make an e-Appointment with HDB Branch to find out more about the Scheme <a href="https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BF13AWAppointmentWeb/branch/" target="_blank">here</a>. <br>

- Click on 'Make a new appointment' 
- Select 'Lease Buyback Scheme' > 'Enquiry'

Choose an appointment date and time, and provide your contact details, before clicking on 'Confirm'. <br>

You will need to attend the appointment with all the co-owner(s), if any.

### Renting out your property/ spare room
