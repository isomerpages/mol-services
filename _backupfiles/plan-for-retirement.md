    content: | 
      According to <a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/retirement" target="_blank">MOM regulations</a>, the official retirement age in Singapore is 62. 
      
      This means your employers cannot ask you to retire before this age. But you can choose to retire earlier and are not expected to work till 67 unless you want to.
  - title: Retirement age VS Re-employment age
    content: |
      If you are healthy and eligible for [re-employment](#eligibility), your employer has to offer you a re-employment contract if you want to continue working until [your re-employment age of 67](https://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/re-employment). 

      Both the retirement age and the re-employment age are meant to protect the interest of workers, not their company. 
  - title: <a name="eligibility"></a>Check Your Eligibility for Re-employment
    content: |
      You are eligible for re-employment if you are:
        - Singapore citizen or Singapore permanent resident
        - With your current employer for at least 3 years before turning 62
        - Considered to have performed well at work, as assessed by the employer
        - Medically fit to continue working
        - Born on or after 1 July 1952

      Upon being re-employed at 65, your employer will receive an additional [Special Employment Credit (SEC)](https://www.sec.gov.sg/){:target="_blank"} of up to 3% of your monthly wage.

  - title: <a name="employer"></a>What It Means for Your Employer
    content: |
      If you are eligible for re-employment but your employer is unable to offer you a position, then your employer must:
      - Help you get re-employment with another employer that you agree to, OR
      - Offer you an one-off <a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/re-employment#employment-assistance-payment-eap" target="_blank">Employment Assistance Payment (EAP)</a>
  - title: Handling Re-employment Disputes with Your Employer
    content: |
      If you are not being offered re-employment within the last 1 month after the last day of your employment, you can notify <a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/appeal-dismissal" target="_blank">Commmisioner for Labor online</a>.

      To dispute unreasonable terms and conditions in your re-employment contract, you can approach <a href="https://www.tal.sg/tadm/eServices" target="_blank">TADM</a> within 6 months from the last day of your employment.

      Planning your retirement as early as possible gives you more time to prepare.

      As <a href="https://www.areyouready.gov.sg/YourLifeEvents/Pages/GoldenYears-StartingEarly.aspx" target="_blank">CPF Rule of Thumb</a>, you would need at least 60% to 70% of your last drawn income for your retirement expenses.
  - title: <a name="ready"></a>Assess if You Are Ready for Retirement
    content: |
      Ensure that you:
        * Have a roof over your head (that is fully paid for)
        * Are free of any debt obligations that you need to pay off<br>
        The fastest and easiest way is to simply log into www.creditbureau.com.sg with your SingPass ID and password to purchase your credit report at $6.42 (including GST).

    content: |
      From your 1st CPF contribution, you would have 3 accounts set up for the three major needs in life (housing, healthcare and retirement).
      
      - MediSave for Healthcare
      - CPF Ordinary Account (CPF OA) for Education and Housing
      - CPF Special Account (CPF SA) for Retirement

  - title: <a name="rstu"></a>Manage Your CPF Well
    content: |
      Your CPF Savings grow in the following ways:

      - Your CPF contributions from you and your employer(s) accumulate throughout your working life.
      - You earn risk-free interest on your CPF savings, at higher rates than from banks and with compounding effect that helps you grow your savings faster.
      - You can also do a top-up to your CPF SA under the <a href="https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Members/Schemes/schemes/retirement/retirement-sum-topping-up-scheme" target="_blank">Retirement Sum Topping-Up Scheme (RSTU)</a> up to the Full Retirement Sum (FRS) (if you are below age 55) or Retirement Account up to the current Enhanced Retirement Sum (ERS) (if you are aged 55 or above). 

      *Tip: Get dollar-for-dollar tax relief of a maximum of $14,000 (up to $7000 for self and up to $7000 for your loved ones) for all top-ups in cash, while enjoying an <a href="https://www.cpf.gov.sg/members/aboutus/about-us-info/cpf-interest-rates" target="_blank">increased interest rate of up to 6% per annum.</a>*

      <a href="https://www.cpf.gov.sg/eSvc/Web/PortalServices/WelcomePage" target="_blank">Check your CPF balances</a> regularly to see if you are on track to reaching your retirement goals.

      When you reach 55 years old, your Special and Ordinary Account savings, up to the <a href="https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Members/Schemes/schemes/retirement/retirement-sum-scheme" target="_blank">Full Retirement Sum (FRS)</a>, will be transferred to a Retirement Account (CPF-RA). 

      Check <a href="https://www.cpf.gov.sg/members/FAQ/schemes/Retirement/Retirement-Sum-Scheme/FAQDetails?category=Retirement&group=Retirement%20Sum%20Scheme&folderid=18088&ajfaqid=2190574" target="_blank">this general guide</a> on the retirement sum you will need to set aside for your desired CPF LIFE monthly payouts.
  - title: <a name="CPFLIFE"></a>How CPF LIFE works
    content: |
      <a href ="https://www.cpf.gov.sg/members/schemes/schemes/retirement/cpf-life" target="_blank">CPF LIFE</a> allows you to get a monthly payout of a basic amount, drawn from your Retirement Account to take care of basic needs after 65.

      This is important especially if you do not have a retirement plan. Your CPF Life payouts are determined based on the following factors:
      - Your gender and age
      - Amount of CPF savings used to join CPF LIFE
      - The CPF LIFE plan you choose
      - CPF interest rates

      *Tip: You may choose to defer your monthly payouts until 70 years old and continue to grow your retirement savings at an interest rate of up to 6% per annum. After 70, the payouts are automatically activated and paid to your bank accounts.*

    content: |
      CPF LIFE has since replaced the <a href="https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Members/Schemes/schemes/retirement/retirement-sum-scheme" target="_blank">CPF Retirement Sum Scheme</a> as the default CPF payout scheme for Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents (born after 1959) in our retirement.

      If you are born before 1958 and/or were already receiving CPF payouts from the Retirement Sum Scheme in 2009, you might be one of those who are still under the Retirement Sum Scheme.

    content: |
      To help you plan your retirement early, the government has made known the amounts for up till 2022: At age 55, you can choose your desired future monthly payout (to be given at the payout eligibility age) from the [three levels of retirement sums](https://www.areyouready.gov.sg/YourInfoHub/Pages/Views-CPF-Retirement-Sum-Explained-for-Young-Singaporeans-MoneySmart.aspx){:target="_blank"}.
        - Basic Retirement Sum (BRS)
          This applies to property owners with remaining lease of at least 40 years and can live on smaller CPF LIFE payouts. 
          Otherwise, you will be required to pledge your property to CPF (i.e if you were to sell or transfer property, you need to top-up your CPF to meet the FRS amount)
        - Full Retirement Sum (FRS)
          For those who are unable the BRS conditions, you will need to meet the FRS instead.
        - Enhanced Retirement Sum (ERS)
          For those who wants higher monthly payouts from CPF LIFE during retirement, but completely on voluntary basis.

  - title: <a name="BRS"></a>When Your CPF Balances Fall below Basic Retirement Sum (BRS)
    content: | 
      If the total balances of both your CPF-Ordinary Account (OA) and  your CPF-Special Account (SA) falls below the BRS, you are allowed to withdraw a maximum of $5,000 while the remaining goes to your Retirement Account. 

      Also, you can pledge your property to withdraw more of your CPF savings but it will lower your CPF LIFE monthly payouts.

    content: |          
      You have a few options to top up to the Retirement Sum.
        - Use cash on hand to top up. Do this as early as possible to maximize the compounding interest rate on your CPF savings.

        - <a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/living-in-an-hdb-flat/for-our-seniors/right-size-with-silver-housing-bonus" target="_blank">Right-size to a smaller flat</a>. You can use the sales proceeds and Silver Housing Bonus to top up your CPF.
    
        - Sell your lease back to HDB. You can then continue living in your current HDB flat while you get to receive monthly income from HDB.

    content: | 
      There are a few options you can consider to get alternative income streams during your retirement years.
        - Rent out a room in your flat
        If you own a HDB flat and have met your Minimum Occupation Period (MOP), you may consider <a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/living-in-an-hdb-flat/for-our-seniors/rent-out-your-flat-bedroom" target="_blank">renting out your entire HDB flat or spare bedroom</a>.
        - Consider working part-time or as a freelancer
        You may have retired, but if you're still healthy and able, you may wish to consider [part-time or temporary positions](https://www.mycareersfuture.gov.sg/){:target="_blank"}, or turn a hobby into gainful employment. 
        - Investing 
        You can consider growing your savings by using your [Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS)](https://www.ifaq.gov.sg/mof/apps/fcd_faqmain.aspx?qst=hRhkP9BzcBImsx2TBbssMsxu7lqt6UJK70a1wAEVmycfm8edPX1dfnExl%2FPIIivbmZUw6xsEEXZ5JbzTDC30P5spbPMxv8H4R3hr7mXvUYX8kZKPLoLCfTcCoTcKmo0mYSFsjnHiwYE2OJ487PqkNktKMsKmGPnrR1qfFcRLDL3GwTZAobcqAw2CQHsVXORCfiq8r00jgpb1gSuoYW7sXMUpUL%2BnQEIhnhS1hlVsGBU%3D){:target="_blank"} account or spare cash on hard to invest.
