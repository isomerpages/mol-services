    <p> MediShield Life is a basic health insurance scheme that provides all Singapore residents with universal and lifelong protection against large healthcare bills, regardless of your age or health conditions.</p>

      <div class="tab-content">      
<p>MediShield Life helps you pay for large hospitalisation bills and selected costly outpatient treatments, such as dialysis and chemotherapy for cancer. </p>

<p>To keep premiums affordable, MediShield Life benefits are sized based on subsidised bills in public hospitals. If you seek unsubsidised treatment in public hospitals or private hospitals, you will also be able to claim from MediShield Life. However, as unsubsidised bills are much higher, MediShield Life will cover a smaller proportion of the bill.</p>

<p>An IP consists of 2 components: MediShield Life, and an additional, private insurance component provided by a private insurer. Thus, IPs provide optional additional coverage if you seek treatment in higher ward classes beyond B2/C wards. </p>

        <p>You should consider the following questions when deciding whether to buy an IP:</p>
        <ol>
        <li><b>Do you need to stay in private wards and do you need to choose your own doctor?</b></li>
        <ul><li> MediShield Life will provide enough coverage for your large hospital bills in B2 or C Class wards in public hospitals.</li>

          <ul>
            <li>The additional private insurance coverage component premiums could be up to 4 times of your MediShield Life premiums, when you are in your 80s.</li>
            <li>Premiums will increase as you get older. You will need to ensure you can afford the higher premiums especially at older ages when you have stopped working.</li>
            <li>IP premiums above the Additional Withdrawal Limits (AWLs) <a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>  will have to be paid in cash. You will need to consider whether you can afford to top up the difference in cash, especially at older ages when you have stopped working.</li>
