<p>MediShield Life helps you pay for large hospitalisation bills and selected costly outpatient treatments, such as dialysis and chemotherapy for cancer. </p>

<p>To keep premiums affordable, MediShield Life benefits are sized based on subsidised bills in public hospitals. If you seek unsubsidised treatment in public hospitals or private hospitals, you will also be able to claim from MediShield Life. However, as unsubsidised bills are much higher, MediShield Life will cover a smaller proportion of the bill.</p>

      <div class="tab-content">
        <p>All Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents are covered under MediShield Life no matter how long you live, regardless of age or health condition. MediShield Life helps to pay for large hospital bills and selected costly outpatient treatments such as dialysis and chemotherapy for cancer. It is sized for subsidised treatment in B2/C wards of the public hospitals</p>
				<p>You do not need an Integrated Shield Plan (IP) if you plan to stay in B2/C wards in public hospitals which are heavily subsidised. In fact, majority of Singaporeans, even those who had bought IP, chose to stay in B2/C wards.</p>
				<p>If you buy an IP but choose to stay in B2/C wards in public hospitals, you might want to reconsider whether you should pay for additional private insurance</p>
				<p>However, if you are firm in choosing B1/A wards in public hospitals or seeking treatment at private hospitals, you can consider getting an IP that matches your ward preference. If so, you should be prepared to pay additional premiums for the additional coverage.</p>

      <label for="ip-choice" class="tab-label">What Should You Consider When You Purchase Or Review Your IP Coverage With Your Insurer?
</label>
      <div class="tab-content">
  <p>Buying and maintaining an Integrated Shield Plan (IP) is a significant lifetime financial commitment. The degree of protection you need evolves and changes with your circumstances and age. As you reach your retirement years, your earning power is likely to reduce while your premiums will rise sharply and your priorities may shift. Depending on your hospital/ward preferences, you may not want to pay additional premiums for an IP. You should consider the following carefully:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Are you likely to choose to seek treatment or be hospitalised at a public or private hospital?</li>
					<li>If you intend to go to a public hospital, will you choose a B2/C ward (six to eight beds) or Standard B1 ward (four beds) or A ward (single ward), taking into account affordability?</li>
					<li>If you intend to stay in B2/C wards, you need not buy an IP. This is because MediShield Life is generally sufficient as payouts are pegged to B2/C wards after government subsidies. The deductible and co-insurance can be paid via MediSave, as well as any remaining co-payment subject to the MediSave withdrawal limits.</li>
					<li>If you prefer to go to a private hospital, assess your means and ability to pay the additional premiums throughout your lifetime. Your annual premiums will increase sharply with age, which means that your premiums will be much higher in your retirement years. Based on the median premiums for each IP plan type, you can potentially save a significant sum.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>You may also refer to the checklist when reviewing your IP coverage.</p>
				<p>Did you know? Your private insurance premiums could be ~5 times of your MediShield Life premiums for someone in their 70/80s.</p>
