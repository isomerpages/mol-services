<h1>Give Your Family Financial Protection</h1>
<h3>Dependants' Protection Scheme (DPS)</h3>
<p>What is DPS?</p>
<p><strong>Dependants’ Protection Scheme (DPS)</strong> is an affordable term
life insurance that covers insured CPF members in the event of death, terminal
illness, or total permanent disability.</p>
<p>DPS provides basic financial protection for your family. You are highly
encouraged to apply for/continue your DPS coverage especially if you belong
to the 'sandwich generation' with young children and elderly parents to
care for. DPS is currently solely administered by <a href="https://www.greateasternlife.com/sg/en/gogreat/solutions/dps.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Great Eastern Life</a> directly.</p>

<p>How to Apply</p>
<p>DPS coverage is automatically extended to all Singaporeans and Permanent
Residents (PRs) between 21 and 65 years old upon their first CPF working
contribution. You may check the status of your DPS coverage through your
yearly CPF Statement of Account, or online through the <a href="https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/ds/dashboards/providing-for-your-loved-ones" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CPF website</a> by
logging in via your Singpass.</p>
<p>If you are 16 years old and above and have not been offered automatic
coverage, you can apply to join DPS with <a href="https://www.greateasternlife.com/sg/en/personal-insurance/our-products/life-insurance/dependants-protection-scheme.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Great Eastern Life</a> directly.</p>
<p>Why You Need DPS</p>
<p>If you are working and have dependants relying on your income, DPS provides
affordable basic protection for your family.</p>
<p>However, you may not require DPS if:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Your dependants have already grown up and/or are financially independent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You have built up enough savings which could be passed on to your dependants
directly in times of need.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You have your own private term or life insurance, which provides enough
protection for your dependants.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>How to Pay Your Premiums</p>
<p>DPS premiums will be automatically deducted from your CPF savings on your
annual policy renewal.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can pay your DPS premiums directly in cash (via GIRO)
to the DPS insurer, Great Eastern Life. Visit Great Eastern Life's website
for more information.</p>

<p>What is CDA?</p>
<p>The <a href="/government-services/govt-benefits/#cash" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Child Development Account (CDA)</a> is
part of the baby bonus scheme designed to help you defray child-raising
costs, such as educational and healthcare expenses at approved institutions</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:600px" height="auto" width="100%" alt="CDA" src="https://www.madeforfamilies.gov.sg/images/default-source/raising-children/cda-table-test.jpg?sfvrsn=421fb19a_2">

<p>What You Can Use CDA For</p>
<p>CDA can be used for your child’s medical and education needs (e.g. paying
for childcare center or outpatient fees) at the <a href="http://www.go.gov.sg/listofai" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">List of Approved Institutions</a>.</p>
<p>Use CDA for a Financial Headstart</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>After signing your child up for the CDA, any unused funds from your CDA

an account that is set up for every Singaporean child when they turn 13.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Note: The PSEA balance earns an interest of 2.5% per annum.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>When your child reach the age of 30, any remaining funds your child have
will be transferred to your CPF Ordinary Account (OA) which gives a higher
interest rate of up to 3.5% and also can be used for his or her future
needs (e.g. housing, education and healthcare).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h1>Support Your Seniors' Retirement</h1>
<h3>Top up for higher payouts under the Retirement Sum Topping-Up Scheme (RSTU)</h3>
<p>What is Retirement Sum Topping-Up Scheme (RSTU)?</p>
<p>The Retirement Sum Topping-Up Scheme (RSTU) helps you grow your retirement
savings and that of your loved ones so that they can enjoy higher monthly
payouts when they retire.</p>
<p>You can top up to your loved ones’ CPF Special Account (if they are below
age 55) or Retirement Account (if they are aged 55 and above). Top-ups
can be made in cash, CPF transfers or both.</p>
<p>4 Reasons You Should Top Up Their CPF for Retirement</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Your top ups to your loved ones’ CPF Special Accounts (for those below
age 55) or Retirement Accounts (for those aged 55 and above) earn attractive
interest of up to 5% or 6% per annum*.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your loved ones enjoy higher monthly payouts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can enjoy tax relief* equivalent to the amount of cash top-ups made,
up to $8,000 per calendar year when you make cash top-ups for your loved
ones (such as parents, grandparents, spouse and siblings.). If you make
a cash top-up for yourself, you can enjoy additional tax relief* of up
to $8,000 per calendar year too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme (MRSS), the Government will
match every dollar of cash top-ups to eligible* seniors who have yet to
reach the Basic Retirement Sum (BRS), up to $600 per year.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>*Terms and conditions apply</em>
</p>
<p>How Much Top-ups can Your Loved Ones Receive?</p>
<p>Your loved ones can log in <a href="https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/ds/dashboards/retirement" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">the CPF website</a> with
their Singpass to view how much they can receive.</p>

<h3>MediSave Top-Ups for Your Seniors at Home</h3>
<p>What is MediSave?</p>
<p>MediSave is a CPF member’s personal healthcare savings account. Working
members save between 8% to 10.5% (depending on age) of their monthly salary
in their MediSave Account. This helps members set aside part of their income
for healthcare expenses, especially those incurred during retirement years.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Your parents would have their own MediSave if they have ever made CPF
contributions, or someone in the family has made voluntary top-ups for
them before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your parents may have also received further MediSave top-ups under the
Pioneer Generation or Merdeka Generation Packages.</p>
</li>
<li>

<a href="https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/healthcare-financing/using-your-medisave-savings" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What Can MediSave Be Used For</p>
<p>MediSave can be used to pay for selected outpatient treatments, hospitalisation
and day surgery expenses, subject to the respective MediSave withdrawal
limits. MediShield Life, ElderShield and CareShield Life premiums are also
fully payable from MediSave.</p>
<p>MediSave can be used for yourself or your family members, including your
parents, grandparents, spouse, children, or siblings.</p>
<p>Why You Should Top Up MediSave Accounts (MAs)</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>You can earn up to 6% interest per annum on your MA savings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can save up faster for your healthcare needs and also use your MA
to pay for your healthcare insurance schemes' premiums</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can enjoy tax relief* by making a cash top-up to your own or your
loved one's MA.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>*Terms &amp; conditions apply</em>
</p>
