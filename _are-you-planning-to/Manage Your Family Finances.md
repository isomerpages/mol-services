<p><b>Dependants’ Protection Scheme (DPS)</b> is an affordable term life insurance that covers insured CPF members in the event of death, terminal illness, or total permanent disability.</p>

<p>DPS provides basic financial protection for your family. You are highly encouraged to apply for/continue your DPS coverage especially if you belong to the 'sandwich generation' with young children and elderly parents to care for. DPS is currently solely administered by <a href="https://www.greateasternlife.com/sg/en/gogreat/solutions/dps.html" target="_blank">Great Eastern Life</a> directly.</p>

  <p>DPS coverage is automatically extended to all Singaporeans and Permanent Residents (PRs) between 21 and 65 years old upon their first CPF working contribution. You may check the status of your DPS coverage through your yearly CPF Statement of Account, or online through the <a href="https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/ds/dashboards/providing-for-your-loved-ones" target="_blank">CPF website</a> by logging in via your Singpass.</p>
      <p>If you are 16 years old and above and have not been offered automatic coverage, you can apply to join DPS with <a href="https://www.greateasternlife.com/sg/en/personal-insurance/our-products/life-insurance/dependants-protection-scheme.html" target="_blank">Great Eastern Life</a> directly.</p>

    <li>You have built up enough savings which could be passed on to your dependants directly in times of need.</li>
