This [cash gift](http://www.go.gov.sg/bbo){:target="_blank"} is disbursed over 4 installments in the first 18 months of the birth of your child.

    To check if the child is eligible for Baby Bonus cash gift, Baby Support Grant and/or CDA benefits, you can use this [Eligibility Checker Tool](https://www.babybonus.msf.gov.sg/parent-helper/){:target="_blank"}.
