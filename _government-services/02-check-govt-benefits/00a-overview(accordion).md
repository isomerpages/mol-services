  - title: Baby-bonus Cash Gift
    content: |
      For each Singaporean child born, you will receive cash of $6,000 for your 1st and 2nd child, and subsequently $8,000 for each of your 3rd and 4th child. This [cash gift](http://www.go.gov.sg/bbo) is disbursed over 4 installments in the first 18 months of the birth of your child.

      To check if the child is eligible for Baby Bonus cash gift, Baby Support Grant and/or CDA benefits, you can use this [Eligibility Checker Tool](https://www.babybonus.msf.gov.sg/parent-helper/).
  - title: Child Development Account (CDA)
    content: |
      The [Baby Bonus Child Development Account (CDA)](https://www.madeforfamilies.gov.sg/raising-families/baby-bonus) is a special savings account. Your child (as a Singapore Citizen) will receive $3,000 upon the opening of the CDA First Step with any of the three banks (DBS, OCBC or UOB). You can continue to save beyond this initial balance and enjoy dollar-for-dollar matching, up to the Government contribution cap in the CDA.

      CDA can be used for your child's medical and education needs at the [list of Approved Institutions](http://www.go.gov.sg/listofai). Any unused balances from this account will be transferred to your childâ€™s [Post-Secondary Education Account](#PSEA) when your child turns 13.

      All Singaporean babies will qualify for the [MediSave Grant for Newborns](https://www.madeforfamilies.gov.sg/raising-families/medisave-grant-for-newborns) of $4,000. A CPF MediSave account will be opened for each newborn automatically, with the grant credited.

      This is to support your child in his or her medical expenses such as MediShield Life premiums, vaccinations, hospitalisation and approved outpatient treatments.
  - title: Edusave Account
    content: |
      All Singaporean students will have an Edusave account where they receive government top-ups for educational use (i.e not a bank account where you can contribute to) 
      
      These contributions are made by the government in the following ways:
      - Government Annual Top-ups: Every February, between age 6 and 16
      - One-off Budget Top-ups: Amount depends on the [annual value of your home](https://www.singaporebudget.gov.sg/docs/default-source/budget_2019/download/pdf/annexd4.pdf)
      - [Edusave Awards and Scholarships](https://beta.moe.gov.sg/fees-assistance-awards-scholarships/awards-scholarships/): Students who have made significant achievements in school academically and non-academically are awarded with Edusave top-ups to their accounts.
  - title: <a name ="PSEA"></a>Post-Secondary Education Account (PSEA)
    content: |
      [Post Secondary Edusave Account (PSEA)](https://beta.moe.gov.sg/fees-assistance-awards-scholarships/psea/) is an account that is set up for every Singaporean child when they turn 13.

      This account consists of any unused funds from your child's [Edusave](https://beta.moe.gov.sg/fees-assistance-awards-scholarships/edusave-contributions/) and CDA account. The PSEA balance earns an interest of 2.5% per annum.

      When your child reach the age of 30, any remaining funds your child have will be transferred to your CPF Ordinary Account (OA) which gives a higher interest rate of up to 3.5% and also can be used for his or her future needs (e.g. housing, education and healthcare).

        Working fathers can enjoy paternity leave to allow you to play a more active role at home upon the arrival of your baby. By default, your paternity leave must be taken in one continuous block (including weekends and public holidays) within 16 weeks from your child's date of birth (inclusive of date of birth). 
        
        However, the 2 weeks of paternity leave can be taken flexibly, if there is mutual agreement between your employer and yourself.
