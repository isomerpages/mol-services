  - title: Types of New Flats
    content: |
      There are various types of flats that are built to suit a variety of needs.
        - 2-room Flexi for small families, singles and elderly
        - 3-room for cosy and compact home
        - 4-room for a comfortable living space
        - 5-room for larger households

  - title: Eligibility Conditions for New Flats
    content: | 
       The eligibility criteria for different flat types depends on your citizenship, age, income ceiling as well as with whom you are applying for the flat (also known as 'co-applicant'). These factors determines which scheme you will be applying under.

       Another criteria to note is that you (and whoever listed in your application) do not own other property overseas or locally, and have not disposed of any within the last 30 months.

       See Also: [Overview of Eligibility Conditions](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/new/eligibility/hdb-flat){:target="_blank"}

  - title: Use Contra Payment Facility if you are an existing HDB flat owner
    content: |
      You can consider [Contra Payment Facility](https://hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/financing-a-flat-purchase/housing-loan-from-hdb/contra-payment-facility-for-new-flats){:target="_blank"} if you are buying an HDB flat and currently owns another HDB flat. 
      
      This can help you to:
        - Reduce the cash outlay needed for your flat
        - Reduce the housing loan amount needed and the subsequent monthly repayments (without incurring interest)
        - Collect the keys to your flat while selling your existing flat<br>
  - title: <a name="grants"></a>Apply for Housing Grants

Apply for these grants to lower the initial purchase price of flat <a href="/government-services/buying-a-hdb/book-flat/" target="_blank">your appointment with HDB</a> if you are eligible.

      **Note**: The amount of grant obtained has to be returned to your CPF Ordinary Account with accrued interest when you sell your flat later. It is <ins>not the same</ins> as subsidy where the prices are 'discounted'.
