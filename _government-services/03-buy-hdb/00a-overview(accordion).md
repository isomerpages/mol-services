      ![Comparing New Flats and Resale Flats](/images/New VS Resale Flat.png)
  - title: Types of New Flats
    content: |
      There are various types of flats that are built to suit a variety of needs.
        - 2-room Flexi for small families, singles and elderly
        - 3-room for cosy and compact home
        - 4-room for a comfortable living space
        - 5-room for larger households  

      [Find out more about the various types and its features](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/new/types-of-flats){:target="_blank"}
  - title: Eligibility Conditions for New Flats
    content: | 
       The eligibility criteria for different flat types depends on your citizenship, age, income ceiling as well as with whom you are applying for the flat (also known as co-applicant). These factors determines which scheme you will be applying under.

       The other key criteria is that you must dispose any existing HDB flat or private property that you or your co-applicants own within 6 months of flat purchase.

You can also take [housing loans from banks](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/financing-a-flat-purchase/housing-loan-from-banks)
      {:target="_blank"}
  - title: How to use CPF savings to pay for your flat
    content: |
      You can [use your CPF Ordinary Account (OA) savings](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Members/Schemes/schemes/housing/public-housing-scheme){:target="_blank"} to buy new or resale HDB flats. 
      
      (1) [Estimate how much CPF you can use to buy your next home](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/eSvc/Web/Schemes/CpfHousingUsage/Input1){:target="_blank"}
      
      (2) Check your [CPF Housing Usage Limit](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/eSvc/Web/Schemes/CpfHousingUsage/Input1){:target="_blank"} so you do not use up your CPF savings for your home

      Get your [required income documents ready](https://hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/financing-a-flat-purchase/housing-loan-from-hdb/income-guidelines-and-other-documents){:target="_blank"} such as your payslips for the past three months and latest 15 months' CPF contribution history.
        [Apply for your Housing Loan Eligibility (HLE) letter](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BP27AWHLEApplication/BP27SHome){:target="_blank"} before your HDB appointment. 
  - title: Use Contra Payment Facility if you are an existing HDB flat owner
    content: |
      You can consider [Contra Payment Facility](https://hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/financing-a-flat-purchase/housing-loan-from-hdb/contra-payment-facility-for-new-flats){:target="_blank"} if you are buying an HDB flat and currently owns another HDB flat. 
      
      This can help you to:
        - Reduce the cash outlay needed for your flat
        - Reduce the housing loan amount needed and the subsequent monthly repayments (without incurring interest)
        - Collect the keys to your flat while selling your existing flat<br>

      **Note**: The amount of grant obtained has to be returned to your CPF Ordinary Account with accrued interest when you sell your flat later. It is <ins>not the same</ins> as subsidy where the prices are 'discounted'.
