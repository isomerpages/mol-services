- title: About the Self-Employed Scheme
  content: |
      If you are a person with your own business, you work for yourself and you are in the position to realise a business profit or loss, you are considered a Self-Employed Person. You do not receive regular MediSave contributions from employers. It is therefore important to contribute regularly and make sure you have sufficient MediSave savings for your future healthcare needs. You can also make voluntary contributions to your other CPF accounts under the [CPF Self-employed Scheme](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Members/Schemes/schemes/self-employed-scheme/self-employed-matters){:target="_blank"}.
- title: Self-Employed MediSave Contribution Calculator 
  content: |
      To find out how much you need to contribute, use this [Self-Employed MediSave Contribution Calculator](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/eSvc/Web/Schemes/SelfEmployedMedisaveContribution/SelfEmployedMedisaveContributionLanding){:target="_blank"}.


cpf-contribute: 
- title: Mandatory Contributions into MediSave Account (MA)
  content: |
      It is mandatory for all Self Employed Persons to contribute to their MediSave Accounts as long as you earn more than $6,000 in Net Trade Income (NTI) for the year. These contributions into your MediSave Account help you manage medical/hospitalisation emergencies, similar to your peers as employed workers.
- title: Contribute-As-You-Earn Scheme
  content: |
      Under this CPF [Scheme](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Members/Schemes/schemes/self-employed-scheme/contribute-as-you-earn-(caye)){:target="_blank"}, a MediSave contribution is required as and when a Self-Employed Person (SEP) earns a service payment. This is a hassle-free way to help SEPs grow their MediSave accounts as their incomes may be seasonal.
      
      The amount of MediSave contribution deducted from your service payment is based on your estimated annual revenue and expenses for the year.
- title: Voluntary CPF Contributions
  content: |
      Any voluntary CPF contributions made to CPF by the self-employed have to be allocated across all 3 CPF accounts, namely CPF Ordinary Account (OA), Special Account (SA) and MA. The allocation ratios are the same as for employed CPF members.

- title: Why You Should Do a Voluntary Contribution to CPF
  content: |
    (1) You get to save on taxes
        Based on your Net Trade Income (NTI) assessed and the actual amount of your contribution, you can get [tax relief](https://www.iras.gov.sg/IRASHome/Individuals/Locals/Working-Out-Your-Taxes/Deductions-for-Individuals/CPF--Central-Provident-Fund--Relief-for-Self-Employed/){:target="_blank"} if you contribute to your CPF.

    (2) You also get higher interest rates on your savings in CPF 
        Generally, CPF monies yield higher interest rate compared to banks. For the first $60,000 in your CPF monies (with up to $20,000 from the OA), you will get an additional 1% interest for your CPF monies. That means you get 3.5% to 5% interest, compared to as low as 0.05% interest in bank accounts.

    (3) You can use the monies for housing, retirement, medical or investment
        Similar to those employed ones, you would likely have the same housing, retirement and medical needs. It makes more sense to save them in your CPF account to enjoy both tax relief and higher interest rate.

    (4) Your CPF monies will be free from debtors
        As a Self-Employed Person, you may be taking personal liability in your work and risk being sued for Liquidated Damages. Nonetheless, your CPF account is protected from creditors. You will still be able to withdraw your CPF monies as an undischarged bankrupt when you turn 55 or for medical reasons.
