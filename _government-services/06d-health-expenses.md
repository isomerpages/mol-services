    <p> MediShield Life is a basic health insurance scheme that provides all Singapore residents with universal and lifelong protection against large healthcare bills, regardless of your age or health conditions.</p>

      <div class="tab-content">      
<p>MediShield Life helps you pay for large hospitalisation bills and selected costly outpatient treatments, such as dialysis and chemotherapy for cancer. </p>

<p>To keep premiums affordable, MediShield Life benefits are sized based on subsidised bills in public hospitals. If you seek unsubsidised treatment in public hospitals or private hospitals, you will also be able to claim from MediShield Life. However, as unsubsidised bills are much higher, MediShield Life will cover a smaller proportion of the bill.</p>

        <li><b>Do you wish to stay in private wards and do you wish to choose your own doctor?</b></li>
        <ul><li> MediShield Life will provide enough coverage for your large hospital bills in B2 or C Class wards in public hospitals.</li>

        <li><b>Can you afford your Integrated Shield Plan premiums in the long term?</b></li>
