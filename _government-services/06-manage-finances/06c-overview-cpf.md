      <div class="tab-content">
    <ol>
     <li>You get to save on taxes:</li>
     <ul>
        <li>Based on your Net Trade Income (NTI) assessed and the actual amount of your contribution, you can get <a target="_blank" href="https://www.iras.gov.sg/IRASHome/Individuals/Locals/Working-Out-Your-Taxes/Deductions-for-Individuals/CPF--Central-Provident-Fund--Relief-for-Self-Employed/">tax relief</a>) if you contribute to your CPF.</li></ul>
    <li>You get higher interest rates on your savings in CPF:</li> 
        <ul>
          <li>Generally, CPF monies yield higher interest rate compared to banks. For the first $60,000 in your CPF monies (with up to $20,000 from the OA), you will get an additional 1% interest for your CPF monies. That means you get 3.5% to 5% interest, compared to as low as 0.05% interest in bank accounts.</li></ul>
    <li> You can use the monies for housing, retirement, medical or investment:</li>
        <ul><li>Similar to those employed ones, you would likely have the same housing, retirement and medical needs. It makes more sense to save them in your CPF account to enjoy both tax relief and higher interest rate.</li></ul>
    <li> Your CPF monies will be free from debtors:</li>
        <ul><li>As a Self-Employed Person, you may be taking personal liability in your work and risk being sued for Liquidated Damages. Nonetheless, your CPF account is protected from creditors. You will still be able to withdraw your CPF monies as an undischarged bankrupt when you turn 55 or for medical reasons. </li></ul>
