## Get Digitally Ready

As Singapore becomes increasingly digitalised, it is important that we equip our citizens to use technology actively, responsibly and confidently.

There are various schemes and initiatives to reach out to individuals, schools and communities across all ages and segments. It provides them with access to technology, digital literacy skills and know-how, on how technology adoption can greatly improve the way we work, live, learn, and play.

We have curated a list of aid and resources across government agencies for you.
