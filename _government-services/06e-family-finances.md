<p><b>Dependants’ Protection Scheme (DPS)</b> is an affordable term life insurance that covers insured CPF members in the event of death, terminal illness, or total permanent disability.</p>

<p>If you belong to the ‘sandwich generation’ with young children and elderly parents to care for, DPS provides basic financial protection for your family. DPS is currently solely administered by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.greateasternlife.com/sg/en/personal-insurance/our-products/life-insurance/dependants-protection-scheme.html">Great Eastern Life</a> directly.</p>

      <div class="tab-content">
  <p>DPS coverage is automatically extended to all Singaporeans and Permanent Residents (PRs) when a valid CPF working contribution is first made between 21 and 65 years old. You may check the status of your DPS coverage through your yearly CPF Statement of Account, or online through <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cpf.gov.sg/eSvc/Web/PortalServices/GetStarted">my cpf Online Services</a>. Simply log in via your Singpass and select “My Messages”.</p>
      <p>If you are 16 years old and above and have not been offered automatic coverage, you can apply to join DPS with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.greateasternlife.com/sg/en/personal-insurance/our-products/life-insurance/dependants-protection-scheme.html">Great Eastern Life</a> directly.</p>

      <div class="tab-content">
  <p>If you are working and have dependants relying on your income, DPS provides affordable basic protection for your family with no out-of-pocket cash required, as DPS premiums can be paid using your CPF savings.</p>
  <p>However, as DPS premiums becomes more expensive with age, you should consider if you currently need a DPS cover. For example, you may not require DPS if:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your dependants have already grown up and/or are financially independent.</li>
    <li>You have built up enough savings which could be passed on to your dependants directly in times of need.</li>
    <li>You have your own private term or life insurance, which provides enough protection for your dependants.</li>
