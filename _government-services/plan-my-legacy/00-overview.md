## Plan your Legacy

Planning ahead can help you receive the care you want, and it can also make things easier for your family when you are nearing the end of life. 
By planning ahead and sharing your preferences through conversations with your loved ones, you can help your loved ones to carry out your wishes calmly and prepared with information, options and costs.

Here's how you can get started in your planning.
