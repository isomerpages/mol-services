sell-eligibility:
  - title: Things to consider before selling
    content: |
      First of all, you should check if you have completed your Minimum Occupation Period (MOP) of 5 years. You can login to [My HDBPage](http://www.hdb.gov.sg/myhdbpage) with your SingPass and check if you have met the MOP to sell your flat, under My Flat > Purchased Flat > Flat Details > Minimum Occupation Period (MOP).
  - title: Check your eligibility to sell
    content: |
      You can only own one HDB flat at a time. You will need to sell your current home before you sign lease agreement of another HDB flat. Check if you are eligible to [sell your existing HDB flat](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/selling-a-flat/eligibility){:target="_blank"}

      If you are selling your old home before buying the new one, work out your moving plans and decide if you need [temporary extension of stay](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/selling-a-flat/procedures/temporary-extension-of-stay){:target="_blank"}.

sales-finances:
  - title: How to calculate your (actual) sales proceeds
    content: |
      Your sales proceeds should be first used to:

        - Pay your [outstanding housing loan](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/AB03FININFO/AB03SSelAcc){:target="_blank"}
        - [Return the CPF monies you had used to pay your current flat](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/eSvc/Web/Schemes/PublicHousingWithdrawalStatement/Statement){:target="_blank"} including the interest that you could have earned if kept in the CPF Ordinary Account
        - Return any [HDB Housing Grant you have previously obtained](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/resale/financing/cpf-housing-grants){:target="_blank"}, with 2.5% accrued interest
        - [Pay any other additional costs and fees](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/selling-a-flat/financing/costs-and-fees){:target="_blank"} which could cost you close to S$3000
