      Log into [My HDBPage](http://www.hdb.gov.sg/myhdbpage) with your SingPass and check if you have met the MOP to sell your flat, under My Flat > Purchased Flat > Flat Details > Minimum Occupation Period (MOP).

      If you are selling your old home before buying the new one, work out your moving plans and decide if you need [temporary extension of stay](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/selling-a-flat/procedures/temporary-extension-of-stay){:target="_blank"}.
