      Firstly, you should check if you have completed your Minimum Occupation Period (MOP) of 5 years. 
      
      Log into [My HDBPage](http://www.hdb.gov.sg/myhdbpage) with your SingPass and check if you have met the MOP to sell your flat, under My Flat > Purchased Flat > Flat Details > Minimum Occupation Period (MOP).
  - title: <a name="check"></a>Check Your Eligibility to Sell

      You can only own one HDB flat at a time and will need to sell your current home before you sign lease agreement of another HDB flat. 
      
      Check your eligibility to sell your flat by [registering your Intent to Sell](#sell) through the [HDB Resale Portal](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BB31AWDashboardWeb/BB31PLogin.jsp){:target="_blank"}.

      If you are selling your old home before buying the new one, work out your moving plans and decide if you need [temporary extension of stay](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/selling-a-flat/procedures/temporary-extension-of-stay){:target="_blank"}.
