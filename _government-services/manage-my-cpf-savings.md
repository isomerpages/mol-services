      <div class="tab-content">
      <p>If you own a business, work for yourself and are in the position to realise a business profit or loss, you are considered a Self-Employed Person (SEP). </p>
      <p>As you do not receive regular MediSave contributions from employers, it is important to contribute regularly to MediSave to ensure you have sufficient savings for future healthcare needs. You can also make voluntary contributions to your other CPF accounts under the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Members/Schemes/schemes/self-employed-scheme/self-employed-matters">Self-Employed Scheme</a>.</p>

      <label class="tab-label" for="medisave">Mandatory Contributions to your MediSave Account (MA)</label>
      <div class="tab-content">
      <p>It is mandatory for all Self-Employed Persons to contribute to their MediSave Accounts as long as they earn more than $6,000 in Net Trade Income (NTI) for the year. These contributions help manage expenses in times of medical or hospitalisation emergencies.</p>

      <label class="tab-label" for="caye">How Much You Need to Contribute</label>
      <div class="tab-content">
     <p> Under CAYE, a MediSave contribution is required as and when a Self-Employed Person (SEP) earns a service payment. This is a hassle-free way to help SEPs grow their MediSave savings, and fulfil their MediSave obligations under the Self-Employed Scheme.</p> 
<p>The amount of MediSave contributions deducted from your service payment is based on your estimated annual revenue and expenses for the year. Use the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cpf.gov.sg/eSvc/Web/Schemes/SelfEmployedMedisaveContribution/SelfEmployedMedisaveContributionLanding">Self-Employed MediSave Contribution Calculator</a> to find out how much you need to contribute.</p></p>

      <label class="tab-label" for="voluntary">Voluntary CPF Contributions as a Self Employed Person (SEP)</label>
      <div class="tab-content">
      <p>As a SEP, you can make voluntary contributions (VC) to either your MediSave Accounts only, or to all three CPF accounts.</p>
      
  <p>Use the<a href="https://www.cpf.gov.sg/eSvc/Web/Miscellaneous/ContributionCalculator/Index?isFirstAndSecondYear=0&isMember=1" target="_blank">CPF Contribution Calculator</a>, or refer to the<a href="https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Assets/employers/Documents/Table%2011_Pte%20and%20Npen_CPF%20Allocation%20Rates%20Jan%202016.pdf" target="_blank">CPF allocation rates expressed as ratios of contribution</a> for the account allocation. </p>

<p>Your total voluntary and mandatory contributions made for the calendar year should not exceed the current <a href="https://www.cpf.gov.sg/employers/FAQ/employer-guides/hiring-employees/cpf-contributions-for-your-employees/FAQDetails?category=Hiring+Employees&group=CPF+Contributions+for+your+Employees&ajfaqid=2230518&folderid=17077" target="_blank">CPF Annual Limit</a>. CPF must also receive the VCs by 31st December of the year for it to be counted towards that year’s CPF Annual Limit. Backdating of VCs to previous years is not allowed.</p>

<p>Once your mandatory and voluntary contributions reach the current CPF Annual Limit, no further VCs can be made. Any VCs made in excess of the CPF Annual Limit will be refunded without interest.</p>
 
<p><em>Note: If your VCs to MediSave are less than your required MediSave contributions, you will need to top up the difference in cash. You will not be able to transfer your VC from your Ordinary or Special Accounts to meet the MediSave shortfall. </em> </p>

      <input type="checkbox" id="why-contribute">
      <label class="tab-label" for="why-contribute">Why Should You Make Voluntary Contributions to Your CPF Accounts?</label>
      <div class="tab-content">
    <ol>
     <li>You save on taxes.</li>
     <ul>
        <li>Based on your assessed Net Trade Income (NTI) and the actual contribution amount, you can get <a target="_blank" href="https://www.iras.gov.sg/IRASHome/Individuals/Locals/Working-Out-Your-Taxes/Deductions-for-Individuals/CPF--Central-Provident-Fund--Relief-for-Self-Employed/">tax relief</a> if you contribute to your CPF.</li></ul>
    <li>You also enjoy higher interest rates on your savings in CPF.</li> 
        <ul>
          <li>Generally, CPF accounts yield higher interest rates compared to banks. The first $60,000 of your CPF savings (with up to $20,000 from your Ordinary Account), earn an additional 1% interest. That means you get 3.5% to 5% interest, compared to as low as 0.05% interest in bank accounts.</li></ul>
    <li>  You can use your savings for housing, retirement, healthcare or investment.</li>
        <ul><li>Just like salaried employees, you would likely have the same housing, retirement and medical needs. Thus, it makes sense to save via your CPF to enjoy both tax relief and higher interest rates.
</li></ul>
    <li> Your CPF savings will be free from creditors.</li>
        <ul><li>As a Self-Employed Person, you may be taking personal liability for your work, and risk being sued for liquidated damages. Nonetheless, your CPF savings are safe from creditors. You will still be able to withdraw your CPF savings as an undischarged bankrupt when you turn 55, or for medical reasons.</li></ul>
