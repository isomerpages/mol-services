## Step 4 : Apply for a Housing Loan

If you are taking out a HDB Housing loan, submit request for [Housing Loan Eligibility (HLE) letter](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BP27AWHLEApplication/BP27SHome).

If you are taking out a housing loan from the banks, you may wish to ensure that you have received approval in principle (AIP) from them.

<em>Tip: Log into [MyHDBpage](http://www.hdb.gov.sg/MyHDBPage) using your SingPass to retrieve the results (under My HDBPage > My Flat > Application Status > New Flat).</em>
