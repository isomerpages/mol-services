# Step 3 : Grant Option to Purchase (OTP)

HDBâ€™s Option to Purchase (OTP) is basically a form of contract between the buyer (you) and the seller, giving you exclusive right to purchase the flat within the option period of 21 calendar days.

As OTP is a legal contract between you and the buyer, it is best that you read all terms and conditions carefully. You can download a copy of HDB-prescribed OTP form [here](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BB24OTPDlWeb/BB24POptionToPurchaseDL_Link)

## Procedures to enter into OTP contract with buyer

To enter into a OTP contract, you would be required to go through the following steps:

(1) Negotiate and agree on Resale price

(3) Buyers to exercise OTP to proceed with the purchase or they can let the OTP expire after 21 calendar days should they decide not proceed with the purchase.
