## Step 6 : Sign Agreement for Lease

#### What to expect

This is usually within four months from the date of booking a flat. Do ensure that you have arranged for a valid HDB Housing Loan Eligibility (HLE) letter or a Letter of Offer (also known as Approval-in-Principle or AIP letter) from a [Financial Institution (FI)](https://mol-services-staging.netlify.app/government-services/buying-a-hdb/finances/) before you sign the Agreement for Lease.
