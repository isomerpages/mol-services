## Step 3: Plan your mode of financing

Buying a flat is a long-term financial commitment. 
Do your sums using the following resources or [HDB financial planning guide](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/financing-a-flat-purchase/step-by-step-guide-to-financial-planning).

- [Step-by-step guide](https://hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/financing-a-flat-purchase/step-by-step-guide-to-financial-planning)

- Read more about [eligibility conditions](https://hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/financing-a-flat-purchase/housing-loan-from-hdb/eligibility-conditions) for the HDB Housing loan

- Check your eligibility for HDB Housing Loan [(HLE e-Service)](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BP13EligCheck/BP13SHome?strSystem=CHECK)

- Prepare for the [required documents](https://hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/financing-a-flat-purchase/housing-loan-from-hdb/income-guidelines-and-other-documents) to apply for your Housing Loan Eligibility letter (HLE)

- Apply for the HLE letter to confirm your eligibility for an HDB housing loan [here](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BP27AWHLEApplication/BP27SHome) with your income documents ready on hand
