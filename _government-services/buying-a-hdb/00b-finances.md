## Step 2 : Plan your Finances

#### Assessing your budget

Buying a flat is a long-term financial commitment. Use the following to plan your finances.

- [Step-by-step guide](https://hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/financing-a-flat-purchase/step-by-step-guide-to-financial-planning)
- Read more about [eligibility conditions](https://hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/financing-a-flat-purchase/housing-loan-from-hdb/eligibility-conditions) for the HDB Housing loan
- Check your eligibility for [HDB Housing Loan Eligibility (HLE) Letter](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BP13EligCheck/BP13SHome?strSystem=CHECK)
- Prepare the [required documents](https://hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/financing-a-flat-purchase/housing-loan-from-hdb/income-guidelines-and-other-documents) for the application of the HDB Loan Eligibility (HLE) letter if you wish to take an HDB housing loan.

*All ready with the required documents? Apply for your HLE letter [here](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BP27AWHLEApplication/BP27SHome)*

Alternatively, you may consider taking up a housing loan from the banks. 
Find out more about the considerations for Financial Institutions (FIs) loans [here](https://hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/financing-a-flat-purchase/housing-loan-from-banks). Do apply for an Approval-in-Principle with the FI to find out about your eligibility for an FI housing loan.

#### Understanding Contra Payment Facility
You may apply for the [Contra Payment Facility](https://hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/financing-a-flat-purchase/housing-loan-from-hdb/contra-payment-facility-for-new-flats) when you are buying a flat from HDB and selling your existing flat concurrently. 

Contra Payment Facility can help you:
- Reduce the cash outlay needed for your flat

- Reduce the housing loan amount needed and the subsequent monthly repayments (thereby saving on interest payments)

- Collect the keys to your flat while selling your existing flat
