## Step 1 : Register your Intent to Buy 

Since 1 January 2018, resale flat buyers and sellers will have to login to the HDB Resale Portal using their SingPass. Hence for you to start buying a resale, you would need to register your [Intent to Buy](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BB31AWDashboardWeb/BB31PLogin.jsp).


#### What to expect 

Upon registration, you will receive an instant assessment on:

- Your eligibility to buy an HDB resale flat 
- Housing grants you are eligible for
- Eligibility for an HDB housing loan

If you are keen to manage your flat purchase yourself, read the detailed guide [here](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/resale/ways-to-buy).

There is no fees involved in this step.


#### Check your Eligibility to buy a Resale Flat

You can buy a resale flat as long as there is at least 1 Singapore Citizen or 2 Singapore Permanent Residents (PR) listed in the application. Read more about the various eligibility schemes [here](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/resale/eligibility-)

<em>Tip: Use this simple [e-Service](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BP13EligCheck/BP13SHome?strSystem=CHECK) to check your eligibility to purchase a resale flat.</em>


#### What to look out for

Consider these factors when evaluating the flat options you intend to buy:

- Resale transacted prices
- Ethnic integration policy (EIP) quotas
- Singapore permanent resident (SPR) quotas 

Using [HDB Map Services](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/web/fi10/emap.html) would help you gather these information by keying in the flat details.


#### What happens after

After registering your Intent to Buy, you will be guided to apply for an HDB Loan Eligibility (HLE) letter, if you are eligible for and intend to get a housing loan from HDB. Otherwise, you will be advised to have an Approval In-Principle (AIP) from the bank before the seller can grant you the Option to Purchase.
