#### File a claim (for unfair retrenchment)
If you believe you are unfairly dismissed due to age, you may [submit an appeal](https://form.gov.sg/#!/5c656ce2a1770a0010563ad4) to Ministry of Manpower (MOM).

If you are a non-union member, [file a claim](https://www.tal.sg/tadm/eservices/employees-file-employment-claim) for mediation with Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM).

To file your claim, you can either fill in [TADMâ€™s e-claim form](https://services.tadm.sg/claims/services/INDIV/INDIV_CaseAgainstEmpChecker.aspx) using SingPass or make an appointment if you do not have a SingPass, along with the following supporting documents:
	
* Employment contract
* Salary payment records and CPF statements;
- Termination or resignation letter; and
- Any other written documents to support your claim
