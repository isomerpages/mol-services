# Check your Eligibility to Purchase Resale

There are a few eligibility schemes for you to purchase a resale flat, as long as there is at least 1 Singapore Citizen or 2 Singapore Permanent Residents (PR) listed in the application. 

Read more about the various eligibility schemes [here](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/resale/eligibility-)

## Register Intent to Buy

Since 1 January 2018, resale flat buyers and sellers will have to login to the HDB Resale Portal using their SingPass. Hence for you to start buying a resale, you would need to register your [Intent to Buy](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BB31AWDashboardWeb/BB31PLogin.jsp).

Upon registration, you will receive an instant assessment on:

- Your eligibility to buy an HDB resale flat 
- Housing grants you are eligible for
- Eligibility for an HDB housing loan

If you are keen to manage your flat purchase yourself, read the detailed guide [here](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/resale/ways-to-buy).
