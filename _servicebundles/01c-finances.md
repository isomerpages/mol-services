## Step 3: Plan your mode of financing your home

Work out your sums with these [HDB financial planning tools](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/financing-a-flat-purchase/step-by-step-guide-to-financial-planning).

Buying a flat is a long-term financial commitment. Use the following to plan your finances.

- [Step-by-step guide](https://hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/financing-a-flat-purchase/step-by-step-guide-to-financial-planning)

- Read more about [eligibility conditions](https://hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/financing-a-flat-purchase/housing-loan-from-hdb/eligibility-conditions) for the HDB Housing loan

- Check your eligibility for HDB Housing Loan [(HLE questionnaire)](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BP13EligCheck/BP13SHome?strSystem=CHECK)

- Prepare for the [required documents](https://hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/financing-a-flat-purchase/housing-loan-from-hdb/income-guidelines-and-other-documents) to apply for your Housing Loan Eligibility letter (HLE)

- Apply for the HLE letter to confirm your eligibility for an HDB housing loan [here](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BP27AWHLEApplication/BP27SHome) with your income documents ready on hand

When you buy a new HDB flat and sell your current flat, the [Enhanced Contra Payment Facility for New Flats](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/resale/schemes-and-grants/enhanced-contra-facility) can help you:
- Reduce the cash outlay needed for your resale HDB flat
- Reduce the mortgage loan amount needed and the subsequent monthly repayments
