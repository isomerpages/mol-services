# Step 2: Plan your Finances

## Compute estimated sales proceeds
Find out how you can [estimate the sales proceeds](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/selling-a-flat/finance/planning) that you could get from selling your flat.

You can also use this [calculator](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BB24SaleProceedCalculator/BB24SSaleProceedsCalc) to estimate how much cash proceeds you might receive and evaluate your financial position. This would be useful in assessing your budget for your next home as well.

## What to consider when deciding selling price of flat

Consider the costs & fees involved in selling your home (e.g. Stamp duty, legal fees, property tax) when deciding your selling price

Find out what [costs and fees](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/selling-a-flat/finance/costs-and-fees) you may need to pay upon selling your flat.

[Check the amount of CPF monies to be refunded to your CPF Ordinary Account (OA) after your sale.](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/eSvc/Web/Schemes/PublicHousingWithdrawalStatement/Statement)
<em>Note: Select "My Public or Private Housing Withdrawal Details" under Property Statement</em>

You may [check the Annual Value (AV) of your current property](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/ESVWeb/default.aspx?target=MPTPropertyPortfolio) at no charge by viewing your property portfolio.

Tip: Find out if you need to pay a [resale levy](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/selling-a-flat/financing/computing-your-estimated-sale-proceeds/selling-a-flat---resale-levy) when you purchase your next home.

Do also refer to this [Checklist of important taxation payments](https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Property/Property-owners/Selling-renting-out-carrying-out-works/Selling-your-Property/) and fees to settle before selling your flat
