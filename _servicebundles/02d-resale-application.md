# Step 4: Submit Resale Application

Both the buyers and sellers must submit their respective portions of the resale application to HDB.

Read about the resale application process [here](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/selling-a-flat/selling-process/resale-application). 
*[Note that either you or the buyer can be the first to submit, but the other party must submit their portion within 7 calendar days.]*

You would also need these documents on hand:

- Option-To-Purchase (OTP) contract details
- Seller Particulars
- Buyer Particulars
- Existing loans with HDB / Financial Institutions
- Declarations of Purchase

After submitting, you would need to endorse the documents and pay necessary fees online before an appointment with HDB can be scheduled.
