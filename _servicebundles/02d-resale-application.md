## Step 4 : Submit Resale Application

You and the buyer (or the salesperson) can proceed to submit the resale application after you have exercised the Option to Purchase (OTP).

Do check if you have the necessary documents [here](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/selling-a-flat/selling-process/resale-application). 
*[Note that either you or the buyer can be the first to submit, but the other party must submit their portion within 7 calendar days.]*

You would also need these documents on hand:

- Option-To-Purchase (OTP) contract details
- Seller Particulars
- Buyer Particulars
- Existing loans with HDB / Financial Institutions
- Declarations of Purchase

Find out about these [requirements](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/selling-a-flat/procedures/resale-application/additional-information-for-selling-a-resale-flat)


#### What to Expect

After submitting, you would need to endorse the documents and pay necessary fees online before an appointment with HDB can be scheduled. Read [more](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/selling-a-flat/procedures/resale-application/after-submitting-a-resale-application-) before proceeding with the submission.

<em>Note that either you or the seller can be the first to submit, but the other party must submit their portion within 7 calendar days.</em>

- Check your [resale application status](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BB31AWDashboardWeb/BB31PLogin.jsp) or get notified via SMS once HDB uploads the approval letter on the resale portal.


<em>Tip: Do note that it takes about 8 weeks from HDB accepting the resale application to the [final step of completing the resale transaction](/resale/complete/) </em>
