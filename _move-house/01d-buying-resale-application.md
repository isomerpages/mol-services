## Step 4 : Submit Resale Application

You and the seller (or the salesperson) can proceed to submit the resale application after you have exercised the Option to Purchase (OTP).
Do check if you have the necessary documents <a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/resale/procedures/resale-application/additional-information-" target="_blank">here.</a>


### What to Expect

After your submission, you would be invited to carry out a <a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/resale/buying-process/application-procedure/resale-application" target="_blank">few more steps</a> that include endorsing resale documents, paying the resale fees online - all before HDB's approval of the transaction.

*Note that either you or the seller can be the first to submit, but the other party must submit their portion within 7 calendar days.*

- Check your <a href="https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BB31AWDashboardWeb/BB31PLogin.jsp" target="_blank">resale application status</a> or get notified via SMS once HDB uploads the approval letter on the resale portal.

*Tip: Do note that it could take about 8 weeks from HDB accepting the resale application to the final step of [completing the resale transaction](/government-services/buying-a-hdb/buying-resale-complete/)*
