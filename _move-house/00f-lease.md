## Step 6 : Sign Agreement for Lease

### What to expect

This is usually within four months from the date of booking a flat. 

Do ensure that you have arranged for a valid HDB Housing Loan Eligibility (HLE) letter or a Letter of Offer (also known as Approval-in-Principle or AIP letter) from a Financial Institution (FI) before you sign the Agreement for Lease.
