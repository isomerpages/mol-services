## Step 6 : Sign Agreement for Lease

### What to expect

This is usually within four months from the date of booking a flat.

Do ensure that you have arranged for a valid HDB Housing Loan Eligibility (HLE) letter or a Letter of Offer (also known as Approval-in-Principle or AIP letter) from a Financial Institution (FI) before you sign the Agreement for Lease.

Read [Step 2](/government-services/buying-a-hdb/finances/) for more information on housing finances.

### There will be payment required at this step 

Do find out more about the <a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/new/finance/costs-and-fees" target="_blank">required payments</a> when you sign the Agreement for Lease.

Eligible flat buyers may also use the <a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/new/staggered-downpayment-scheme" target="_blank">Staggered Downpayment Scheme</a> where they can pay their downpayment in 2 instalments i.e. half when they sign the Agreement for Lease and the remaining amount when they collect the keys to their flat.
