## Update my personal details

After moving to your new home, do be reminded to notify the change in your residential address to <a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/docs/default-source/ica/files/sharing-of-address-updates-with-public-agencies-(oscars).pdf" target="_blank">these organisations</a> through ICA.

For organisations not on this list, you may have to inform them of your change in residential address separately through their official channels.

As a resident in Singapore, you may bring your current NRIC and <a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/documents/ic/update_residential_address" target="_blank">documentary evidence showing your new address</a>.

More information on how to update your residential address at ICA <a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/documents/ic/update_residential_address" target="_blank">here</a>.
