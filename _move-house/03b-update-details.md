## Update your personal details

After moving to your new home, do be reminded to notify the change in your residential address to [these participating government agencies](https://www.ica.gov.sg/docs/default-source/ica/files/sharing-of-address-updates-with-public-agencies-(oscars).pdf). 

See [how you can update your residential address](https://www.ica.gov.sg/documents/ic/update_residential_address)

Do note that even if you have updated your new address with ICA, you will still need to separately notify private institutions and non-participating public agencies.
