## Step 1 : Register your Intent to Buy 

Since 1 January 2018, resale flat buyers and sellers will have to login to the HDB Resale Portal using their SingPass. Hence, for you to start buying a resale flat, you would need to register your <a href="https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BB31AWDashboardWeb/BB31PLogin.jsp" target="_blank">Intent to Buy.</a>


### What to expect 

Upon registration, you will receive an instant assessment on:

- Your eligibility to buy an HDB resale flat 
- Housing grants you are eligible for
- Eligibility for an HDB housing loan

If you are keen to manage your flat purchase yourself, read the detailed guide <a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/resale/ways-to-buy" target="_blank">here.</a>

There are no fees involved in this step.


### Check your Eligibility to buy a Resale Flat

You can buy a resale flat as long as there is at least 1 Singapore Citizen or 2 Singapore Permanent Residents (PR) listed in the application. Read more about the various eligibility schemes <a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/resale/eligibility-" target="_blank">here.</a>

*Tip: Use this simple <a href="https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BP13EligCheck/BP13SHome?strSystem=CHECK" target="_blank">e-Service</a> to check your eligibility to purchase a resale flat.*


### What to look out for

Consider these factors when evaluating the flat options you intend to buy:

- Resale transacted prices
- Ethnic integration policy (EIP) quotas
- Singapore permanent resident (SPR) quotas 

Do use the <a href="https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/web/fi10/emap.html" target="_blank">HDB Map Services</a> to obtain these information by keying in the postal code or flat details.


### What happens after

After registering your Intent to Buy, you will be guided to apply for an <a href="https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BP27MaxLoan/BP27PMax1.jsp" target="_blank">HDB Loan Eligibility (HLE) letter</a>, if you are eligible and intend to get a housing loan from HDB. 

Otherwise, you will be advised to have an Approval In-Principle (AIP) from <a href="https://hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/financing-a-flat-purchase/housing-loan-from-banks" target="_blank">Financial Institutions (FIs)</a> before the seller can grant you the Option to Purchase.
