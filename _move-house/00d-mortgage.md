## Step 4 : Apply for Housing Loan

If you are taking out a HDB Housing loan, submit request for <a href="https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BP27AWHLEApplication/BP27SHome" target="_blank">Housing Loan Eligibility (HLE) letter.</a>

If you are taking out a housing loan from the <a href="https://hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/financing-a-flat-purchase/housing-loan-from-banks" target="_blank">Financial Institutions(FIs)</a>, you may wish to ensure that you have received approval in principle (AIP) from them.

Do read <a href="/government-services/buying-a-hdb/finances/">step 2</a> for more information and resources on housing loans.

*Tip: Log into <a href="http://www.hdb.gov.sg/MyHDBPage" target="_blank">MyHDBpage</a> using your SingPass to retrieve the results (under My HDBPage > My Flat > Application Status > New Flat).*
