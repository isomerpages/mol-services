## Step 2 : Plan your Finances

### Assessing your budget

Buying a flat is a long-term financial commitment. To finance a flat purchase, buyers can use cash, CPF savings, housing grants (if eligible) and take a housing loan from HDB (if eligible) or from the financial institution. Use the following to plan your finances and check your eligibility if you wish to take up an HDB housing loan.
