## Step 4 : Submit Resale Application

You and the buyer (or the salesperson) can proceed to submit the resale application after you have exercised the Option to Purchase (OTP).

Do check if you have the necessary documents <a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/selling-a-flat/selling-process/resale-application" target="_blank">here</a>. 
*Note that either you or the buyer can be the first to submit, but the other party must submit their portion within 7 calendar days.*

You would also need these documents on hand:

- Option-To-Purchase (OTP) contract details
- Seller Particulars
- Buyer Particulars
- Existing loans with HDB / Financial Institutions
- Declarations of Purchase
