## Being Healthy with my family


### Get your health checks regularly

It is recommended to keep track of your health through regular screenings. <a href="https://eservices.healthhub.sg/PersonalHealth/ScreeningEligibility" target="_blank">Check your eligibility for subsidised screenings</a> using your SingPass login.

If you are eligible, you can make an appointment at your <a href="https://www.chas.sg/clinic_locator.aspx?id=90" target="_blank">preferred CHAS GP clinic</a> for the screening. Do bring along your NRIC and/or CHAS/MG/PG card at the appointment to enjoy the subsidised rate of $5 or even lower if you are a senior.
