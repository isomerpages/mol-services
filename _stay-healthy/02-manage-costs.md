## Managing my healthcare costs

### Healthcare Schemes and Subsidies

**CPF Schemes for Healthcare**

In Singapore, there are a few schemes you (as a CPF member) could tap on when you have a heavy medical bill to pay for.

- <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/schemes-subsidies/medisave/medisave_booklet_b5_complete_fa_rev2_path.pdf" target="_blank">MediSave</a>: a personal medical savings account-as a monthly contribution from our income (if you are an employed worker)

- <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/cost-financing/healthcare-schemes-subsidies/medishield-life" target="_blank">MediShield Life</a>:a nation-wide basic healthcare insurance plan to help offset some of the costs from large hospital bills and selected outpatient treatments

If you are sick or injured, you can check how much you can claim by using this <a href="https://www.cpf.gov.sg/eSvc/Web/Schemes/MedisaveCalculator/Step1" target="_blank">calculator</a>

**Medical subsidies**

Since 1 Nov 2019, all Singapore citizens are now eligible to apply for the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) - which offers you to get medical subsidies for medical and/or dental care at selected GP clinics.
