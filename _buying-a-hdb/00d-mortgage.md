## Step 4 : Apply for Housing Loan

If you are taking out a HDB Housing loan, submit request for [Housing Loan Eligibility (HLE) letter](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BP27AWHLEApplication/BP27SHome).

If you are taking out a housing loan from the [Financial Institutions(FIs)](https://hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/financing-a-flat-purchase/housing-loan-from-banks), you may wish to ensure that you have received approval in principle (AIP) from them.

Do read [Step 2](/buying-a-hdb/finances/) for more information and resources on housing loans.

*Tip: Log into [MyHDBpage](http://www.hdb.gov.sg/MyHDBPage) using your SingPass to retrieve the results (under My HDBPage > My Flat > Application Status > New Flat).*
