## Step 2 : Get Option to Purchase (OTP)

### Decide if you prefer to get it done yourself or with an agent

As most of us are digitally connected and with the launch of HDB resale portal, it is almost possible to complete the resale transaction yourself. However, there could still be merits to appoint salesperson(s) to guide you in the resale journey.

### What is Option to Purchase (OTP)

HDBâ€™s Option to Purchase (OTP) is basically a form of contract between the buyer (you) and the seller, giving you exclusive right to purchase the flat within the option period of 21 calendar days.

Do make sure that you have made your housing loan arrangements before you exercise your OTP. This could be a valid HDB Housing Loan Eligibility (HLE) letter or a valid Letter of Offer/Approval In-Principle (AIP) from any financial institutions (FI).

As OTP is a legal contract between you and the seller, it is best that you read all terms and conditions carefully. You can download a copy of HDB-prescribed OTP form [here](https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BB24OTPDlWeb/BB24POptionToPurchaseDL_Link)


### Procedures to enter into OTP contract with seller

To enter into a OTP contract, you would be required to go through the following steps:

(1) Negotiate and agree on Resale price

(2) Seller grant OTP to you

(3) Make use of the Option Period to review purchase

(4) Exercise OTP to proceed with the purchase 

You can also choose to let the OTP expire if you decide not to proceed with the purchase.
