## Digital Skills Curriculum

### Learning Digital Skills

Feeling a little lost in the digital world? Fret not, we have put together a list of resources for you to learn more about the digital services commonly used in this digital society.

*Tip: Take a [Basic Digital Skills quiz](https://confirmation.gevme.com/BDS_Quiz/landing/)to find out how digitally ready you are.


- [Getting Information and Communicating digitally](https://imsilver.imda.gov.sg/learn-digital-skills/learn-online/e-communications-bds/)

- [E-payments](https://imsilver.imda.gov.sg/learn-digital-skills/learn-online/digital-transactions-bds/)

- [Government Digital Services](https://imsilver.imda.gov.sg/learn-digital-skills/learn-online/government-digital-services-bds/) such as SingPass Mobile and other digital services by government agencies
