## How to Plan Ahead

Planning ahead can help you receive the care you want, and it can also make things easier for your family or your loved ones when you are nearing the end of life.

There are various ways you can plan ahead. For a detailed guide to help in your planning, click [here](https://www.mylegacy.gov.sg/guides/planning-ahead/why-plan-ahead/) to read more on the considerations.


### Start a Conversation

[Start a conversation with your loved ones](https://www.livingmatters.sg/start-the-conversation/overview/). Having a discussion with them helps them in making difficult decisions later on without knowing what you want. 


### Write a Will

You can make a will as early as 21 years old. Writing a Will allows you to decide what happens to your assets and possession after your death. To find out more how you can do so, read [more](https://www.mylegacy.gov.sg/guides/planning-ahead/write-a-will/).

Do consider stating your preferences and views for other important healthcare decisions in your will too. Read more about [the considerations](https://www.mylegacy.gov.sg/guides/planning-ahead/other-healthcare-decisions/) to think about when writing your Will.

*Tip: The first step could start with taking stock of your estate. Use this [net worth calculator](https://www.moneysense.gov.sg/financial-tools/net-worth-calculator) or get to know your assets [here](https://www.moneysense.gov.sg/articles/2018/11/calculating-the-value-of-your-estate)*


### CPF nomination

(1) Choose your nominees and decide how much each person should receive
(2) Decide on the type of CPF nomination for each nominee
(3) [Make your CPF nomination online](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/eSvc/Web/Schemes/MakeCpfNomination/Home) using your SingPass to log in or head down to CPF branch office in-person.

### Make an Advance Care Plan

Advance care planning (ACP) is the process of putting together a plan for your future health and personal care, which involves considerations of your own beliefs and preferences if you ever lose the capacity to make decisions or speak for yourself.

Find out how you can make an advance care plan [here](https://www.mylegacy.gov.sg/guides/planning-ahead/make-an-advance-care-plan/how-to-make-an-advance-care-plan/).

The ACP facilitator will then submit and record your advance care plan in the National ACP IT System.

### Make a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA)

A lasting power of attorney (LPA) is a legal document that allows you (the 'donor') to appoint someone you trust to make decisions and act on your behalf should ever you lose mental capacity.

(1) Personal Welfare
(2) Property and Affairs

If you don't have an LPA and you lose mental capacity, your family member is not automatically given the right to make legal decisions on your behalf. Your family member will have to apply to Court to be appointed as your deputy, before they are authorised to make decisions and act on your behalf.This can hinder their ability to care for you.

*Tip: If you are ready to make your ACP, you may use this [tool](https://www.mylegacy.gov.sg/tools/lpa-acp-tool/) here to fill out both your LPA and ACP forms online. After your form has been completed with the ACP facilitator, both you and your selected healthcare spokesperson(s) need to sign the completed form.*
