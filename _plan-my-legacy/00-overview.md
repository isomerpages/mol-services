## Getting Started

Planning is critical. Part of planning is to do some self-reflection and have conversations with loved ones on the things that matter and make the right decisions about the legacy you want to leave behind. 


For a detailed guide to help in your planning, click <a href="https://www.mylegacy.gov.sg/end-of-life-planning/why-plan-ahead/" target="_blank">here</a> to read more on the considerations.


### Start a Conversation

<a href="https://www.livingmatters.sg/start-the-conversation/overview/" target="_blank">Start a conversation with your loved ones</a>. Having a discussion with them helps them in making difficult decisions later on without knowing what you want. 


### Write a Will

You can make a will as early as 21 years old. Writing a Will allows you to decide what happens to your assets and possession after your death. To find out more how you can do so, read <a href="https://www.mylegacy.gov.sg/end-of-life-planning/write-a-will/" target="_blank">more.</a>

Do consider stating your preferences and views for other important healthcare decisions in your will too. Read more about <a href="https://www.mylegacy.gov.sg/end-of-life-planning/other-healthcare-decisions/" target="_blank">the considerations</a> to think about when writing your Will.

*Tip: The first step could start with taking stock of your estate and assets.

### Make an Advance Care Plan

Advance care planning (ACP) is the process of putting together a plan for your future health and personal care, which involves considerations of your own beliefs and preferences if you ever lose the capacity to make decisions or speak for yourself.

Find out how you can make an advance care plan <a href="https://www.mylegacy.gov.sg/end-of-life-planning/make-an-advance-care-plan/" target="_blank">here.</a>

The ACP facilitator will then submit and record your advance care plan in the National ACP IT System.

### Make a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA)

A lasting power of attorney (LPA) is a legal document that allows you (the 'donor') to appoint someone you trust to make decisions and act on your behalf should ever you lose mental capacity.

- Personal Welfare
- Property and Affairs

If you don't have an LPA and you lose mental capacity, your family member is not automatically given the right to make legal decisions on your behalf. Your family member will have to apply to Court to be appointed as your deputy, before they are authorised to make decisions and act on your behalf.This can hinder their ability to care for you.

*Tip: If you are ready to make your ACP, you may use this <a href="https://www.mylegacy.gov.sg/lpa-acp-tool/" target="_blank">tool</a> here to fill out both your LPA and ACP forms online. After your form has been completed with the ACP facilitator, both you and your selected healthcare spokesperson(s) need to sign the completed form.*
