## Organising your Important Documents

We often take for granted that we will have the capacity to make our own decisions and speak for ourselves, thus we forget documenting our views and preferences for our future selves is also essential when planning ahead. 

Read [here](https://www.mylegacy.gov.sg/guides/planning-ahead/organise-important-documents/) for a checklist of these important planning ahead documents.


### Share your funeral wishes

Do consider stating down your funeral wishes as part of your documents. Read through [considerations here](https://www.mylegacy.gov.sg/guides/planning-ahead/share-your-funeral-wishes/) to guide you in doing so.


### Storing your documents

Wills and other planning ahead documents would only be most useful if your loved ones are able to access them when they need it. Having a secure place to store them is essential. Store your important documents in [your Legacy Vault](https://www.mylegacy.gov.sg/vault) using your SingPass and nominate who would be able to access these documents after your death.
