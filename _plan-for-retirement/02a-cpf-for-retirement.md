## CPF For Retirement

### CPF Savings

From the moment you make your first CPF contribution to your Ordinary, Special, and Medisave Accounts (OA, SA, and MA), you are already leveraging on the risk-free and attractive interest rates.

When you turn 55, a Retirement Account (RA) is created for you where your savings can earn up to 5% interest* per annum. On top of this, you will also be eligible to earn an additional 1% interest on the first $30,000 of your combined balance, with up to $20,000 from your OA.

*Do note that this includes an extra 1% interest paid on the first $60,000 of a memberâ€™s combined CPF balances, with up to $20,000 from the OA.*



### Retirement Sum Scheme (RSS)

The <a href="https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Members/Schemes/schemes/retirement/retirement-sum-scheme" target="_blank">Retirement Sum Scheme (RSS)</a> provides you as a CPF member a monthly income to support a basic standard of living during retirement. This is the amount of retirement savings which you have chosen to set aside in your Retirement Account (RA) to receive monthly payouts from your payout eligibility age, which is currently at age 65.

Read <a href="https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Assets/members/Documents/PEA_Infographic_English.pdf" target="_blank">more</a> on the 5 things to note about your CPF monthly payouts after turning 65.



### CPF Life
Your retirement sum can be used to join CPF LIFE which provides you with life-long monthly payout or the Retirement Sum Scheme which provides you with a monthly payout until your Retirement Account balance is depleted
