## Monetising your property

If you own an HDB flat or a property in Singapore, you could consider the following options to have another source of retirement income. 


### (A) Right-sizing with Silver Housing Bonus

After retiring, you could consider <a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/living-in-an-hdb-flat/for-our-seniors/right-size-with-silver-housing-bonus" target="_blank">right-sizing your flat</a> and obtain Silver Housing Bonus (SHB) to supplement your retirement income. As your adult children establish their own homes, you may consider selling your existing flat and buying a smaller flat from either the resale market or from the HDB.


### (B) HDB Lease BuyBack Scheme 

In this option, you could continue living in your current HDB flat while selling part of your flatâ€™s lease back to HDB. The proceeds will be used to top up your CPF Retirement Account (RA), from which you will get a steady income under the CPF Life scheme. By doing so, you can still continue living in your flat throughout your retirement.
