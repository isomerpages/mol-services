## Monetising your property

If you own an HDB flat or a property in Singapore, you could consider the following options to have another source of retirement income. 

### Right-sizing with Silver Housing Bonus

Assuming that you no longer require such a spacious home after retiring, you could consider <a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/living-in-an-hdb-flat/for-our-seniors/right-size-with-silver-housing-bonus" target="_blank">right-sizing your flat</a> to supplement your retirement income. As your adult children establish their own homes, you may consider selling your existing flat and buying a smaller flat from either the resale market or from the HDB.

### HDB Lease BuyBack Scheme 

If you own an HDB flat, you can consider selling part of your flatâ€™s lease back to HDB. The proceeds will be used to top up your CPF Retirement Account (RA), from which you will get a steady income under the CPF Life scheme. By doing so, you can still continue living in your flat throughout your retirement. Find out how you can do so <a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/living-in-an-hdb-flat/for-our-seniors/lease-buyback-scheme" target="_blank">here.</a>

### Renting out your property/ spare room

If you own a HDB flat and have met your Minimum Occupation Period (MOP), you may consider <a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/living-in-an-hdb-flat/for-our-seniors/rent-out-your-flat-bedroom" target="_blank">renting out your entire HDB flat or spare bedroom</a>.

### Silver Housing Bonus

If you are selling your current flat or private housing with Annual Value not exceeding $13,000 and buying a 3-room or smaller flat, you can supplement your retirement income through the <a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/living-in-an-hdb-flat/for-our-seniors/right-size-with-silver-housing-bonus" target="_blank">Silver Housing Bonus (SHB)</a>. Find out how you can apply for the SHB and receive up to $30,000 cash bonus when you use some of your sale proceeds from right-sizing to top up your CPF Retirement Account and join CPF LIFE.
