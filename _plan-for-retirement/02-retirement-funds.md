## Plan your Retirement Funds

## CPF For Retirement

### CPF Savings

From the moment you make your first CPF contribution to your Ordinary, Special, and Medisave Accounts (OA, SA, and MA), you are already leveraging on the risk-free and attractive interest rates.

When you turn 55, a Retirement Account (RA) is created for you where your savings can earn up to 5% interest* per annum. On top of this, you will also be eligible to earn an additional 1% interest on the first $30,000 of your combined balance, with up to $20,000 from your OA.

*Do note that this includes an extra 1% interest paid on the first $60,000 of a member’s combined CPF balances, with up to $20,000 from the OA.*


### Retirement Sum Scheme (RSS)

The <a href="https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Members/Schemes/schemes/retirement/retirement-sum-scheme" target="_blank">Retirement Sum Scheme (RSS)</a> provides you as a CPF member a monthly income to support a basic standard of living during retirement. This is the amount of retirement savings which you have chosen to set aside in your Retirement Account (RA) to receive monthly payouts from your payout eligibility age, which is currently at age 65.

Read [more](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Assets/members/Documents/PEA_Infographic_English.pdf) on the 5 things to note about your CPF monthly payouts after turning 65.


### CPF Life
Your retirement sum can be used to join CPF LIFE which provides you with life-long monthly payout or the Retirement Sum Scheme which provides you with a monthly payout until your Retirement Account balance is depleted

Already 65? [Apply online](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/eSvc/Web/Schemes/MonthlyPayoutsFromMyRetirementAccount/BeginRequest) to start your monthly payouts and change Bank Details under CPF Retirement Sum Scheme.

## Monetising your property

If you own an HDB flat or a property in Singapore, you could consider the following options to have another source of retirement income. 


### Right-sizing with Silver Housing Bonus

Assuming that you no longer require such a spacious home after retiring, you could consider <a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/living-in-an-hdb-flat/for-our-seniors/right-size-with-silver-housing-bonus" target="_blank">right-sizing your flat</a> to supplement your retirement income. As your adult children establish their own homes, you may consider selling your existing flat and buying a smaller flat from either the resale market or from the HDB.


### HDB Lease BuyBack Scheme 

If you own an HDB flat, you can consider selling part of your flat’s lease back to HDB. The proceeds will be used to top up your CPF Retirement Account (RA), from which you will get a steady income under the CPF Life scheme. By doing so, you can still continue living in your flat throughout your retirement. Find out how you can do so <a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/living-in-an-hdb-flat/for-our-seniors/lease-buyback-scheme" target="_blank">here.</a>

### Renting out your property/ spare room

If you own a HDB flat and have met your Minimum Occupation Period (MOP), you may consider <a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/living-in-an-hdb-flat/for-our-seniors/rent-out-your-flat-bedroom" target="_blank">renting out your entire HDB flat or spare bedroom</a>.


### Silver Housing Bonus

If you are selling your current flat or private housing with Annual Value not exceeding $13,000 and buying a 3-room or smaller flat, you can supplement your retirement income through the <a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/living-in-an-hdb-flat/for-our-seniors/right-size-with-silver-housing-bonus" target="_blank">Silver Housing Bonus (SHB)</a>. Find out how you can apply for the SHB and receive up to $30,000 cash bonus when you use some of your sale proceeds from right-sizing to top up your CPF Retirement Account and join CPF LIFE.


## Investing

Alternatively, you may consider closing up the savings gap by investing. However, this approach may not be suitable for everyone so do take time to carefully consider whether it suits your financial situation and risk appetite.
