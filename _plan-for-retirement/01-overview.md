# Ways to save for retirement

### CPF for retirement

From the moment you make your first CPF contribution to your Ordinary, Special, and Medisave Accounts (OA, SA, and MA), you're already leveraging on the risk-free and attractive interest rates.

When you turn 55, a Retirement Account (RA) is created for you where your savings can earn up to 5% interest* per annum. On top of this, you will also be eligible to earn an additional 1% interest on the first $30,000 of your combined balance, with up to $20,000 from your OA.
*Including an extra 1% interest paid on the first $60,000 of a member’s combined CPF balances, with up to $20,000 from the OA.
